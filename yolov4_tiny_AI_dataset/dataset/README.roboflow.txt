The dataset includes 903 images.
Toy are annotated in YOLO v3 Darknet format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random shear of between -10° to +10° horizontally and -10° to +10° vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -15 and +15 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2.5 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1.01 percent of pixels
